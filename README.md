# Pac-Man RL Project (ECE 194D)

Based on Berkeley Pac-Man game code, created a Q-learning agent to maximize Pac-Man's score against Ghost agents.
Ghost agents were initially randomized, then set to follow the game rules of conventional Pac-Man, and finally learned how to attack Pac-Man strategically while working together (adversarial)
